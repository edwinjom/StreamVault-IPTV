# Task 1 Report: Enforce the final settings boundary

## Status

RED demonstrated. The final settings boundary is specified by tests and the existing Gradle guard, but the current production dependency intentionally remains, so the boundary task fails as required before production migration.

## Changes

- Removed `:data` from the settings boundary's approved project-dependency set.
- Added a fixture-only `com.streamvault.data` token so the boundary scan requires detection of data imports without rejecting current production data imports.
- Added `feature/settings/src/test/resources/boundary-fixtures/DataImport.kt` using `import com.streamvault.data.sync.SyncProgressBus`.
- Extended `SettingsModuleBoundaryTest` to require that the build file omit `project(":data")`.
- Preserved the production `implementation(project(":data"))` dependency and existing production source token list, as required for this RED task.

## Verification

Command:

```text
gradlew.bat :feature:settings:verifyFeatureSettingsBoundary --no-daemon
```

Result: expected failure, exit code 1.

Relevant failure:

```text
:feature:settings project dependencies must be exactly [:core:navigation, :core:ui, :domain, :player]; found
[:core:navigation, :core:ui, :data, :domain, :player]
```

This confirms the RED boundary is failing specifically because the existing `:data` project dependency is still present. The generated boundary report was not produced because the task stops at the dependency assertion.

Gradle also reported 28 configuration-cache problems, including two unique problems for this existing execution-time boundary task. These are ancillary warnings and are not the cause of the intended failure.

## Graph maintenance

Ran `graphify update .` successfully after modifying code files. Graphify rebuilt the code graph with 13,862 nodes, 24,410 edges, and 473 communities.

## Commit scope

The commit contains only the Task 1 boundary build/test/fixture changes and this report. The captured test log remains uncommitted.

## Round 1/5 fix

Finding addressed: the fixture guard previously proved only detection of the import phrase `import com.streamvault.data`; it did not prove detection of fully-qualified `com.streamvault.data...` usages.

Fix details:

- Test file: `feature/settings/src/test/java/com/streamvault/feature/settings/SettingsModuleBoundaryTest.kt` now asserts that the build logic contains the broader `com.streamvault.data` token.
- Fixture file: `feature/settings/src/test/resources/boundary-fixtures/FullyQualifiedDataReference.kt` adds a fully-qualified `com.streamvault.data.sync.SyncProgressBus` reference.
- Build logic: `feature/settings/build.gradle.kts` adds the broader `com.streamvault.data` token to fixture-only scanning and requires both the import and fully-qualified fixture violations. The production token list and production source scan remain unchanged for Task 4.

Exact command:

```text
gradlew.bat :feature:settings:verifyFeatureSettingsBoundary --no-daemon
```

Result: expected RED, exit code 1. The task failed specifically on the existing project dependency:

```text
:feature:settings project dependencies must be exactly [:core:navigation, :core:ui, :domain, :player]; found
[:core:navigation, :core:ui, :data, :domain, :player]
```

The task did not fail because of the fixture scan, confirming the broader-token fixture logic is accepted while the current `:data` dependency remains the RED cause. The prior untracked `task-1-boundary-test.log` was removed after this evidence was recorded; the rerun output was not persisted to a new log.
