# Phase 5 Catalog - Task 12 device journeys

Date: 2026-09-03

The configured API 36 TV emulator was booted and authorized. Automated
connected coverage exercised the feature-owned selection semantics and the four
golden entry points; app navigation and platform compatibility suites also
passed. A debug production APK was then installed with the configured public
M3U fixture. Provider sync returned HTTP 200 and staged 1,467 live channels.

The available seeded production surfaces were checked on-device:

- Home loaded on `streamvault.destination:home` (the update notice was visible).
- Live TV loaded on `streamvault.destination:live_tv` and exposed the seeded
  channel/category surface (`All Channels` showed 1,319 channels in this run).
- Movies and Series loaded on their routes and correctly reported `Sync needed`
  because the M3U fixture has no VOD payload.
- Search accepted the query `3ABN` and rendered seven Live TV results (Movies
  0, Series 0); the earlier `CNN` query also rendered its no-match state.

The on-device logcat spot scan showed the provider-sync HTTP 200/staging path
and no `com.streamvault.app.debug` fatal exception. Repeated UIAutomator dumps
emitted their own `UiAutomationService ... already registered` noise, and
platform Cast/StrictMode noise was not treated as Catalog evidence.

Full VOD/series Catalog journeys were **not run in this public-M3U pass**
because that fixture has live channels only. The route captures used for this
pass are ignored local files; no production screenshots or raw logcat are
committed. A later temporary Xtream fixture follow-up exercised the missing
movie/series/detail/search paths; see
`task14-xtream-fixture-journeys.md` for its scope and remaining limitations.

Unavailable journey set:

- Dashboard shelves, customization save/cancel, and focus traversal
- Movies/Series/VOD filtering, sorting, load-more, detail return, and episode focus
- Search typing/results activation and Favorites direct-host rendering
- Detail favorite, variant, copy URL, download, and Cast chooser flows
- Phone/tablet, RTL, and reduced-motion variants

These remain the next acceptance gate once a seeded test fixture and production
activity harness are available. The connected golden follow-up is documented in
`task12-connected-validation.md`; the feature-owned baselines remain preserved
for rerun.
